## NOL

I considered the NOL as 40% because of the average of the difference between the loaded status.

## React

This is a React app.\ created with `create-react-app`
I used React because it is the framework that I am most familiar with. I also used React Hooks to manage the state of the application.
I did implement a Redux store but I did not use it because I did not need it. Neither I created unit tests.
